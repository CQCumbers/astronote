## Welcome to Astronote
An astronote notebook ends with .astro and is simply a collection of markdown files. Notes can be nested - leaf notes are .md files, while higher level notes are directories containing an index.md file. Astronote automatically caches external links used in your notes in a \_cache directory under the .astro folder. All changes to notes are autosaved, and LaTeX is supported. You can preview how a rendered note looks using the eye icon on the toolbar.

To get started, try creating a new subnote using the buttons on the left.
